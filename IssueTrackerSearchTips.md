**Modifying the List View:**


> Above the list of Issues there is a pull down combo-box that will list for you the various filters for what Issues will be displayed.  It is usually set to only show Open issues, but there are other filters that will allow you to see All issues and Your issues.  If you have clicked the Star next to important issues that you want to keep track of, it will also show you Starred Issues.



**Starring Important Issues:**


> By "starring" an issue, you not only mark that the issue is important to you.  It will also allow us on the administration side, to sort the list by the issues that have the most stars.  This helps us know what issues are the most important to all users.

**Activity Notification Settings:**


> At the top right of the screen is a link for _My Profile_, and clicking that will get a Tab for settings.  Under settings you have two options for getting automatic email updates.  One is to get an email for your issues and the other is to get an email for your starred issues.  With an option checked you will get an email any time an issue meeting the option is updated.  The email will contain the change to the issue.
